        <h3 id="rules">HOW TO PLAY 'SIMON SAYS GAME'</h3>
        <ul > RULES : 
            <li>Click on start to start the game.</li>
            <li>One of the four buttons will blink (color changes to white for a very short moment). <br>You need to remember which button blinked and click on it to move to next level.</li>
            <li>If you click the right button you will be promoted to the next level.</li>
            <li>When you're promoted to the next level a new button will blink.</li>
            <li>You need to remember the order of buttons blinked click on both the buttons in that same order. </li>
            <li>For example, if on clicking start 'green' button blinks then in level 1 you need to click only on 'green' button. 
                If in the next level i.e at level 2 'blue' button blinks then you need to click on 'green' button first and then 
                'blue' button. In next level if 'red' blinks then you need to click on 'green', 'blue' and 'red' respectively. The game continues the same way for higher levels too.
            </li>
            <li>If you click all the buttons in correct order in a particular level then only you can play the next level.</li>
            <li>You can see that no. of buttons you need to click in a particular level is equal to that level no.</li>
            <li>If you click any wrong button the game stops in that moment.</li>
            <li>Your score is number of levels you have successfully completed in that round.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            REMEMBER:
            <li>To start a new round click on 'RESTART'.</li>
            <li>Don't refresh the page if you want to see scores of the rounds you played continuously.</li>
            <li>You can play as many rounds as you want.</li>
            <li>To know scores of all the rounds you have played click on 'Show Score Card' button.</li>
            <li>You can also see the highest score among all the rounds played.</li>
        </ul>
